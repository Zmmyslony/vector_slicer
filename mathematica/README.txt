The Mathematica (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) module defined here can be used for generation of
input files and reading the results from Vector Slicer. In the future, it is planned to add an API, so that
the slicing can also be done directly from within the notebook.

The Demondstration.nb contains shows how the module is meant to be used, while the external part of the
module is written in VectorSlicerIntegration.m and the internal part is in VectorSlicerInputGenerator.m and
VectorSlicerOutputGenerator.m.
